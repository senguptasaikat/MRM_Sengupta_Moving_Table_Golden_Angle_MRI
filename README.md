MRM Sengupta CMT Golden Angle
=============================

CMT Golden Angle is an algorithm for reconstructing
Golden and Linear angle, radial, continuously moving
table MRI scan data. Code to download CMT MRI raw data
from online storage, reconstruct image volumes and reproduce
figures presented in the journal Magnetic Resonance in Medicine
publication, *Continuously Moving Table MRI with Golden Angle
Radial Sampling*, is included.  

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
* **2016-03-18** : Data files moved from shutdown cloud storage service to be available as binaries associated with the github.com v1.0 release of this repository; updated download Python script and download CSV index file; removed MATLAB download files that do not work with zipped data files; updated download instructions; removed google analytics beacon on top level README.md file.
