MRM Sengupta CMT Golden Angle
=============================

CMT Golden Angle is an algorithm for reconstructing
Golden and Linear angle, radial, continuously moving
table MRI scan data. Code to download CMT MRI raw data 
from online storage, reconstruct image volumes and reproduce 
figures presented in the journal Magnetic Resonance in Medicine
publication, *Continuously Moving Table MRI with Golden Angle 
Radial Sampling*, is included.
